---

## Quick Setup Options

### Option 1: Use Test Email Service (Immediate - For Development)

**No configuration needed!** The system automatically uses Ethereal Email for testing.

**How to test:**
1. Try changing password in the application
2. Check server console for email preview URLs
3. Visit the preview URL to see the email

### Option 2: Enable Real Email Sending (For Production)

#### Step 1: Choose Email Provider

**For Gmail (Recommended):**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail
2. Go to Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí App passwords
3. Generate app password for "Mail"
4. Use the 16-character password

**For Other Providers:**
- Outlook: Use regular email/password
- Custom SMTP: Get SMTP settings from provider

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# For Gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password

# For Outlook
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password

# For Custom SMTP
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.yourdomain.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
```

#### Step 3: Restart Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
