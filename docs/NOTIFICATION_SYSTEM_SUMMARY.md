## üîß Configuration & Setup

### System Integration
1. **Server Routes**: Added to `backend/server.js`
2. **Database Models**: Notification model with MongoDB TTL indexing
3. **Authentication**: All endpoints protected with JWT authentication
4. **Role-based Access**: Admin endpoints for notification statistics

### Notification Service Configuration
```javascript
// Auto-start notification service
const notificationService = require('./services/notificationService');
notificationService.start(); // Checks every 30 minutes for checkout reminders
```

### Frontend Polling
- Notification dropdown polls for unread count every 30 seconds
- Full notifications page refreshes on filter/search changes

## üìä Notification Types & Triggers

### 1. Checkout Reminder (`checkout_reminder`)
- **Trigger**: Employee completes standard work hours but hasn't checked out
- **Frequency**: Once per day per employee
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Message**: "You have completed X hours of work (Y hours required). Consider checking out if you're done for the day."

### 2. Auto-Checkout (`auto_checkout`)
- **Trigger**: Employee automatically checked out due to inactivity
- **Frequency**: When auto-checkout occurs
- **Priority**: High
- **Message**: "You have been automatically checked out at [time] due to inactivity."

### 3. Overtime Alert (`overtime_alert`)
- **Trigger**: Employee earns overtime hours on checkout
- **Frequency**: On checkout with overtime
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Message**: "You have earned X hours of overtime." or "Smart overtime applied: X hours reduced from shortage, Y hours counted as overtime."

### 4. System Notifications (`system`)
- **Trigger**: Admin-initiated system-wide announcements
- **Frequency**: As needed
- **Priority**: Configurable
- **Message**: Custom system messages

## üß™ Testing

### Test Script
- **`backend/test-notification-system.js`**: Comprehensive testing script
  - Tests all notification types
  - Validates CRUD operations
  - Tests notification service functionality
  - Verifies TTL expiry
  - Bulk notification testing

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Notification creation and storage
- ‚úÖ Mark as read functionality
- ‚úÖ Notification queries and filtering
- ‚úÖ Service-based notification sending
- ‚úÖ Bulk operations
- ‚úÖ TTL expiry mechanism
- ‚úÖ API endpoint functionality

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### For Employees
1. **View Notifications**: Click the bell icon in the navbar
2. **Mark as Read**: Click on unread notifications or use "Mark as Read" button
3. **Full View**: Click "View All Notifications" for complete management
4. **Search**: Use search bar to find specific notifications
5. **Filter**: Filter by type, status, or priority

### For Administrators
1. **Send System Notifications**: Use the notification API to send system-wide messages
2. **View Statistics**: Access notification statistics via admin endpoints
3. **Monitor Service**: Check notification service status and logs

### API Usage Examples

```javascript
// Get recent notifications
const response = await notificationAPI.getRecentNotifications({ limit: 5 });

// Mark notification as read
await notificationAPI.markAsRead(notificationId);

// Get unread count
const { unreadCount } = await notificationAPI.getUnreadCount();

// Send system notification (Admin only)
await notificationAPI.createNotification({
  recipient: userId,
  title: 'System Maintenance',
  message: 'Scheduled maintenance tonight',
  type: 'system',
  priority: 'high'
});
```

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Features

### Smart Overtime System
- Notifications automatically sent when overtime is calculated
- Includes information about shortage hours reduction
- Differentiates between regular and smart overtime

### Auto-Checkout System
- Notifications sent when employees are auto-checked out
- Includes timestamp and reason for auto-checkout
- High priority to ensure visibility

### Attendance Management
- Checkout reminders based on work hours completion
- Integration with system settings for work hour configuration
- Respects user roles and permissions

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Indexes**: Optimized indexes for recipient, date, and read status
- **TTL**: Automatic cleanup of old notifications (30 days)
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination for large notification lists

### Frontend Optimization
- **Polling**: Reasonable polling intervals (30 seconds for unread count)
- **Caching**: Local state management for notification data
- **Lazy Loading**: Pagination prevents loading all notifications at once

### Scalability
- **Service Architecture**: Separate notification service for business logic
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient bulk notification creation and updates
- **Queue Ready**: Architecture supports future queue implementation

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

### Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints require valid JWT authentication
- Role-based access control for admin functions
- Users can only access their own notifications

### Data Privacy
- Notifications contain only necessary information
- Automatic expiry prevents indefinite data retention
- Secure API endpoints with proper validation

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for instant notifications
2. **Email Notifications**: Optional email delivery for important notifications
3. **Push Notifications**: Browser push notifications for critical alerts
4. **Notification Templates**: Customizable notification templates
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Notification engagement analytics
6. **Mobile App Integration**: API ready for mobile app notifications

### Extensibility
